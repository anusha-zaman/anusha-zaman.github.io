                <p><b>Summary: </b>Experimental archive exploring 1) South Asian women gathering, storytelling, creating counternarratives online; 
                    2) creative web design for nonlinear storytelling using artifacts and cybertext.</p> 
                <p><b>Keywords: </b>simulacra, subjectification, surveillance, centralization, cyberfeminism, femonationalism, homonationalism, subaltern studies, alternative archives</p>
                <p><b>Motivation: </b>I am a South Asian woman with several identities marginalized in the United States and on the English-language Internet, chief among those being queer, 
                    low-income, disabled, and Muslim. All of these affect how I traverse the Internet and determine what information feels safe to share.
                <p>There is limited visibility of South Asian women in English-language media, with existing representation being superficial and/or extreme, as well as hegemonic: 
                    Indocentric, Hinducentric, casteist, Islamophobic.
                There is also a long history of in-group surveillance of South Asian women across religious and social classes. One major example is the practice of purdah, the religious 
                and social practice of female seclusion. This takes the form of physical segregation of the sexes, with women sequestered inside the home and men able to move freely; 
                enforced veiling of women to cover their skin and conceal their figure; and surveillance of (younger) women by their intergenerational family unit.</p>
                <p>There are currently limited theoretical frameworks for understanding the gendered and sexual constructions of South Asian women, especially as it pertains to our behavior online. 
                    In this project, I hope to introduce a new dimension to purdah—the virtual—to understand how digital surveillance and seclusion affects the visibility and self expression of South Asian women
                     on the English-language Internet, especially those marginalized on the basis of caste, class, queerness, disability, indigeneity, and ethnicity.</p>
                <p><b>Methods—<em>Guiding theory: </em></b> My practice pulls from Marxist postcolonial and subaltern thought (e.g. Jasbir Puar), subaltern cyberfeminism (e.g. Radhika Gajjala, Lisa Nakamura), 
                    spatiality studies (e.g. Jean Baudrillard), assorted scholars of women, gender, and sexuality in the South Asian diaspora, and selected works about ethics in digital ethnography. </p>       
                <p><b>Methods—Artifact collection: The</b> general curatorial ethos follows that of the Cyberfeminism Index, embracing that this archive will always be incomplete. 
                    “South Asian women” is not merely the concatenation of South Asia and women, but an imperfect umbrella term, an oversimplification of the existing diversity of identities and ideas. 
                    I am searching for artifacts using snowball sampling to prioritize marginalized groups due affected by algorithmic suppression. I prioritize marginalized groups, 
                    informally or self published works, and other individual methods of combating hegemony (i.e. prioritizing a personal zine, blog, or net art over a thinkpiece in a popular publication).
                <p><b>Deliverable—Experimental archive:</b> Inspired by electronic literature and alternative archives with nonlinear, non-directional or multi-directional cybertext, user-guided delivery of 
                    contents and nonviolent creative code.</p>
