                <p>For the last ~3 years, I have been running political education initiatives and organizing around
                    housing with Harvard Taskforce for AAPI Studies and Advocacy (2020), Neighbor Program Cambridge
                    (2021), and Boston Housing = Health (2022). </p>
                <p>Longer-term, I'd like to run a hybrid (virtual and in-person) and mixed-use community center with education, food, and housing support for low-income, qtpoc youth and community organizers.</p>
                <p>I'm interested in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Apocalyptic imagination as exhortation of societal participation</li>
                    <li>Critical studies of transmasculinity in film and literature</li>
                    <li>Cyberfeminism</li>
                    <li>Cyberpunk, apocalyptic, and post-apocalyptic science fiction</li>
                    <li>Degrowth economies</li>
                    <li>Digital organizing and cybernetics of care</li>
                    <li>Hypermasculinization of South Asian women and postcolonial transgressive femininity</li>

                    <li>The military-industrial-academic complex, especially in bioengineering</li>
                </ul>
                <p></p>

                    writing, experimental publishing (zines, manga, electronic literature), and data science. </p>
