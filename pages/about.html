                <p>For the last ~4 years, I ran political education initiatives with Harvard Taskforce for AAPI Studies and Advocacy (TAPAS), Neighbor Program Cambridge, Boston Housing = Health, and Harvard Square Community Fridge. I also
                    hosted sexual education events with over 1000 attendees with SEHCS; conducted research on vaginal metagenomics and HIV/STI pop-up clinic models; advocated for greater scope of university health services;
                    created initiatives on menstrual equity; and engaged 300 first-year students through programming on gender identity and exploration. </p>
                <p>Longer-term, I plan to pursue a JD/PhD in reproductive biology to work in impact litigation focused on reproductive justice and trans rights.
                    The current landscape of reproductive rights is being shaped by individuals often lacking scientific expertise, while scientific spaces are terribly apolitical.
                </p>
                <p>I'm interested in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Apocalyptic imagination as exhortation of societal participation</li>
                    <li>Cyberfeminism</li>
                    <li>Digital organizing, cybernetics of care, consensual computing</li>
                    <li>Folk technologies, scripting as scripture, poetic computing</li>
                    <li>Sex differences research</li>
                    <li>Surveillance and pleasure in intimate health technologies</li>
                    <li>Techno-orientalism and counternarratives of computing in South Asia</li>
                    <li>The military-industrial-academic complex in bioengineering</li>
                </ul>
                <p></p>
                <p>My creative practice engages with these topics and more through photography,
                    writing, experimental publishing (zines, manga, electronic literature), and data science. </p>
